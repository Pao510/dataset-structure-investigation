# 📊 Structure Your Data – Unicorn Companies Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **structuring and preparing the Unicorn Companies dataset** for further analysis.  
The goal was to understand the dataset’s content, identify potential issues, and ensure it was ready for business insight analysis.  

Unlike the main Unicorn Companies analysis project, which focused on trends and insights, this project emphasizes **data cleaning, validation, and structural exploration**.

---

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Inspect the dataset to understand its **shape, columns, and data types**  
- Check for **missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies**  
- Summarize **numeric and categorical features** (e.g., valuations, industries, countries)  
- Perform **basic descriptive statistics** (count, mean, median)  
- Ensure the dataset is **clean and structured** for downstream analysis  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas – Data manipulation  
- NumPy – Numerical operations  

---

## 📂 Key Steps Performed  
1. **Data Loading** – Imported Unicorn Companies dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
2. **Data Structure Inspection** – Checked number of rows/columns, column names, and datatypes  
3. **Null & Missing Values** – Identified and documented missing entries across features  
4. **Duplicates** – Checked for duplicate records in the dataset  
5. **Descriptive Statistics** – Generated summary statistics (count, mean, median, min, max) for numerical columns  
6. **Categorical Analysis** – Explored industries, countries, and investors to understand unique values and distributions  
7. **Data Readiness** – Ensured the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for deeper business analysis
